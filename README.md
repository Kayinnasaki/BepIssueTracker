# BE:P Issue Tracker

For reporting bugs for those with aceess to the Brave Earth: Prologue Alpha

This is a public tracker, so if you're not on the alpha, feel free to look around and see what sorts of bugs and issues I have to deal with during development. No actual code or game files will be hosted here.

If you're part of the alpha and have a bug, please create a GIT account to report your bugs. Then hit the Issues button on the right hand bar (!)

Please, one bug per issue report, unless the bugs are seemingly all related. I'll take a big blob of bugs over no bug reports, but more issue reports, the easier it is for me to track what I fixed.
